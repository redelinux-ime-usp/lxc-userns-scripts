lxc-userns-scripts

Convenience scripts for creating user-namespace isolated Linux containers

These utility scripts and hooks are intended for the specific use case of
running user-namespace isolated container, but not necessarily wanting to create
new containers from secondary users. This way features like auto-starting still
work properly.

The main script is `lxc-create-with-userns`: it is mostly a wrapper around
lxc-create that will do all the necessary work of finding and unused UID and GID
range, enabling it in shadow's configuration files, and creating a compatible
container file. Some useful hooks will also be automatically added to new
containers to allow them to be cloned succesfully into new namespaces.

The hooks included, follow by their respective allowed hook types, are:

userns-allow (clone|pre-start)
    Applies the configuration needed for the creation of new usernamespaces for
    containers, creating new ones in case of a clone, to make sure thei work
    properly, and that other hooks can enter the namespaces to do their work.
userns-convert (clone)
    Converts a cloned container to a new user namespace, shifting all the file
    ownerships on the rootfs to the new ranges.
sysprep (clone)
    Cleans up per-instance configuration from containers, like shell history,
    ssh keys, puppet certificates, DHCP leases. It also generates a new root
    password. Since it's user-namespace aware, it must be called *after*
    userns-allow or it won't be able to enter the namespace.
