Installation procedure

This project uses autotools for it's build system. autoconf and automake are
necessary for the build, and a basic C compiler and C library too.

The procedure is the usual `./configure && make && make install`. If your system
includes the `checkinstall` program, you can substitute `make install` for
`make deb`, which will generate a Debian package for later installation.
